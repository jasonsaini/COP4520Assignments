Problem 1 (100 points)
Your non-technical manager assigns you the task to find all primes between 1 and
108. The assumption is that your company is going to use a parallel machine that
supports eight concurrent threads. Thus, in your design you should plan to spawn 8
threads that will perform the necessary computation. Your boss does not have a strong
technical background but she is a reasonable person. Therefore, she expects to see that
the work is distributed such that the computational execution time is approximately
equivalent among the threads. Finally, you need to provide a brief summary of your
approach and an informal statement reasoning about the correctness and efficiency of
your design. Provide a summary of the experimental evaluation of your approach.
Remember, that your company cannot afford a supercomputer and rents a machine by
the minute, so the longer your program takes, the more it costs. Feel free to use any
programming language of your choice that supports multi-threading as long as you
provide a ReadMe file with instructions for your manager explaining how to compile and
run your program from the command prompt.

Required Output:
Please print the following output to a file named primes.txt:
<execution time> <total number of primes found> <sum of all primes found>
