Correctness
Objective: The program simulates a party scenario where a Minotaur invites guests to enter a labyrinth one at a time. Each guest can enter the labyrinth and decide to eat a cupcake or leave it. The goal is to identify when all guests have visited the labyrinth at least once.

Implementation:

Atomic Variables: The use of AtomicInteger for guestsWhoEntered and AtomicBoolean for gameFinished ensures thread safety, providing accurate counts and states in a multithreaded environment.

Synchronization: The synchronized block with lock object ensures that only one thread modifies the shared resources (cupcake, guestsWhoEntered, gameFinished) at a time, preventing race conditions.
Guest Logic: Each guest thread, represented by the Guest class, follows the specified rules. Non-leader guests enter once, while the leader guest enters repeatedly to track the number of unique guests.
Termination Condition: The game finishes when the leader guest announces that all guests have visited the labyrinth, set by checking guestsWhoEntered.get() == totalGuests - 1.

Efficiency

Thread Management: The program efficiently creates and manages threads, with each guest represented as a separate thread. This parallelism simulates the scenario more realistically than a sequential approach.
Resource Locking: The program minimizes the scope of synchronized blocks, reducing the potential for thread contention and improving performance.
Early Termination: Threads exit the enterLabyrinth method early if the game is finished, reducing unnecessary computations.

Experimental Evaluation

Functional Testing: Tests can be conducted by setting different numbers of guests and verifying if the count of guests who entered matches the total number of guests.
Performance Analysis: The performance can be analyzed by measuring the time taken for different numbers of guests, ensuring scalability.
Concurrency Testing: Testing in a multithreaded scenario to ensure that the shared resources are managed correctly without any race conditions or deadlocks.

Limitations and Recommendations

User Input Dependency: The program requires user input for the number of guests, which could be automated or parameterized for testing purposes.
Hardcoded Logic: The role of the leader guest is hardcoded. A more flexible design could allow for dynamic role assignment.
Output Verbosity: The current implementation provides verbose output for each action, which is useful for understanding the flow but might be overwhelming. This could be controlled with a verbosity flag.
In conclusion, the "Minotaur Party" program demonstrates a good understanding of concurrency and thread management in Java, with an emphasis on thread safety and synchronization. The program's design aligns well with the specified objective, providing an efficient and correct implementation of the given scenario.
